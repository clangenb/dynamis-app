workspace:
  - app

environment:
  sdk: ">=3.6.0 <4.0.0"

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.4.7

  command:
    bootstrap:

      usePubspecOverrides: true

  # Notes:
  # 1.  On windows the multiline operator doesn't work in most cases, so we should try to have one liner scripts commands
  #     connected with '&&'.
  # 2.  make sure that you have installed the project dependencies with ./flutter/bin/dart pub get. Otherwise, melos
  #     will fallback to the globally installed version and errors might occur.
  #
  # Cross platform linebreaks:
  # * Can only be used with a `melos exec` command, which must be after directly before the command to be executed. So
  #   after the `--` if a filter is used.
  # * Only works with the `>-` multiline operator for windows support.
  #
  # For more complex scenarios, we can consider writing cross-platform dart scripts as mentioned in this issue:
  # https://github.com/invertase/melos/issues/122
